How to use:

2. set your prefered polling time (time in seconds to ping the server for new image data, default is 10 seconds)

4. ???
5. profit with spicy images your friends make you look at xD

NOTE: keep config.txt in the same folder as the .exe file - the .exe downloads the image temporarily so its adivsed to keep all this inside its own folder, also feel free to set the .exe to run at startup if you always want to use this as your wallpaper
